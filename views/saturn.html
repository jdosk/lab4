                                <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun. The most immediate feature of Saturn is its rings. While they look solid, the rings are actually small bits of ice and rock orbiting the planet. Like Jupiter and the other gas planets, Saturn is predominantly made of gasses swirling around the planets core. Like Jupiter, Saturn has several moons due to its strong gravitational pull.</p>
